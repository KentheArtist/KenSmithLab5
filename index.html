  <h1>Colonizing Other Planets (But Should We?)</h1>
    <p>Space travel -- something that has fascinated humans for as long as they gazed up at the moon, the stars, and whatever starlike planets could be seen in the night sky.</p>
    <p>It was once accepted wisdom that the earth was the center of the solar system, and all the other planets and the sun revolved around it. A rebel named Galileo was nearly executed for suggesting otherwise. We now know that, in reality, our small, fragile but resilient blue planet is just another member of our solar system, and is the ideal distance from the sun to make our current way of life possible without dome-covered cities, oxygen tanks and weighted boots.</p>
    <p>Should we really be planning a six to eight month trip to Mars or any other planet when we don't even know what happened to a Malaysian passenger jet that completely disappeared from air traffic control radar four years ago during what should have been a routine 6 hour and 20 minute trip?</p>
    <p>Let's look at the four closest planets to the sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.</p>
